Immediate:
- Test manual exposure times with CCD on windows with QML and QCamera

Features:
- Automatic exposure/gain to keep highest value at 95% * 2^8
- Manual exposure for image source camera (-> switch from video to single images?)
- Ability to show a window with FFT (via Python)
- Ability to send data to arbitrary Python scripts
- Multi-Zooming and syncing with draw canvas
- Persistant settings

Try to get manual exposure time to work:
- With opencv for Python?
- With opencv for C++? (must be built first?)
- With QML on Windows?
- With QCamera on Windows?
- With COM and Python (would be specific to TIS)?

How to get data transfer to Python working:
- Via C++ class which links to Python
- Via pyotherside
